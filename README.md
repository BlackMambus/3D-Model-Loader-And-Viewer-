# 3D-Model-Loader-And-Viewer-

A 3D Model Loader and Viewer is a software tool or application that enables users to import, render, and interact with 3D models. It plays a crucial role in industries like game development, architecture, engineering, AR/VR, and digital content creation.

ðŸ”§ Key Features
Model Importing: Supports loading a variety of file formats (e.g., .obj, .fbx, .glTF, .3ds, .dae) for ease of use across different modeling software.

Rendering Engine: Uses OpenGL, DirectX, Vulkan, or WebGL to visualize 3D models with realistic lighting and shading.

Navigation Controls: Allows users to rotate, pan, zoom, and explore the model from different angles.

Material & Texture Handling: Loads associated materials and textures, including normal maps, specular maps, and environment maps.

Animation Support: Some viewers handle rigged models and keyframe animations.

Scene Graph: Organizes model components hierarchically for better interaction and manipulation.
